# Jarvis – AI Voice Assistant (Python)

Jarvis is a Python-based AI voice assistant that listens to user commands through a microphone, understands speech, and responds intelligently using text-to-speech and AI models. The project is built to demonstrate how voice interfaces and AI-driven logic can be combined to create a practical desktop assistant.

This repository is suitable for learning purposes, experimentation with AI assistants, and as a foundation for building more advanced voice-controlled systems.

## Features
- Voice command input using microphone
- Speech-to-text processing
- Text-to-speech responses
- AI-powered conversational responses
- Music playback support
- Modular and easy-to-extend codebase
- Test scripts for microphone and AI model integration

## Tech Stack
- Python 3
- Speech Recognition
- Text-to-Speech (TTS)
- AI/LLM integration (Gemini test included)

## Project Structure
- `main.py` – Entry point of the assistant  
- `config.py` – Configuration settings  
- `client.py` – AI interaction logic  
- `musicLibrary.py` – Music handling utilities  
- `mic_test.py` – Microphone testing  
- `test_gemini.py` – AI model testing  

## How It Works
1. The assistant listens for voice input via the microphone.
2. Speech is converted into text.
3. Commands are processed using predefined logic or AI responses.
4. The assistant replies using synthesized speech.

## Future Scope
- Wake-word detection
- Improved conversational memory
- Cross-platform support
- API and smart device integration
- Plugin-based command system
